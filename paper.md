# Title
Model-measurement comparison of biomass burning aerosol 
aging of biomass burning aerosol over West Africa

# Introduction
we present measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
Particle size was measured was using a PCASP, 
as described in Bloggs et al 2004.
Smith et al (1998) conducted several studies in 
this region, but continental-scale measurements
have not previously been made.

Add third paper in intro.

# Simulations 
we simulate the evolution of BBOA over W Africa,
using John's model

# Methodology
We compared simulations from John's model
(Smith et al 2005) with our measurments.
